## Implemented Attacks

The following attacks are implemented within the repo.

* Spectre-v1 or Bounds Check Bypass [1]
    * condBranchMispred.c
* Spectre-v2 or Branch Target Injection [1]
    * indirBranchMispred.c

## Not Completed Attacks

The following attacks are in-progress and are not working yet.

* Return Stack Buffer Attack [2]
    * returnStackBuffer.c
    * Main reason why this doesn't work is because the RSB was disconnected in the BPU (commented out). 

# Building the tests

To build you need to run `make`

# Running the Tests

This builds "baremetal" binaries that can directly run on the BOOM configuration that was specified above.
